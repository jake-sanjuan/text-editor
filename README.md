# text-editor
This is a simple text editor I created just to get a feel for Tkinter and also to give myself more practice with Python.
It has functionality that allows the user to create new files, access saved files, and text in new and saved files.
I wanted to add more functionality, but did not use an object oriented approach.  I hope to update this in the near
future with a better apraoch and updated functionality
